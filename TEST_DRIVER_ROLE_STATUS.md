# Driver Role Status Update & UI Improvement Test

## Changes Made

### Backend (ratingsController.js)

1. ✅ Added `role_status` field to the target_user query
2. ✅ Added `driverRoleStatus` field to the response mapping
3. ✅ Fixed address fields to be fetched from `rides` table instead of `bookings` table
4. ✅ Updated pickup and dropoff location mapping to use `ride.pickup_address` and `ride.drop_address`
5. ✅ **Added `unsuspendUser` function to reinstate suspended drivers**
6. ✅ **Added route for unsuspending drivers at `/api/ratings/unsuspend/:userId`**

### Frontend (Feedback.vue)

1. ✅ Added `driverRoleStatus` field to the driver reports mapping
2. ✅ Updated status display condition to treat `null`/`undefined` role_status as 'active'
3. ✅ **Moved suspend action from table to feedback details dialog**
4. ✅ **Improved dialog layout with dedicated "Driver Management Actions" section**
5. ✅ Updated action column to only show "View Details" button and suspended status indicator
6. ✅ Fixed logic to properly handle database schema where active drivers have `null` role_status
7. ✅ **Added "Unsuspend Driver" button for suspended drivers**
8. ✅ **Enhanced status display to show "Active (Approved)" for unsuspended drivers**
9. ✅ **Updated handleDriverAction to support both suspend and unsuspend operations**

### Frontend Service (ratingsService.js)
1. ✅ **Added `unsuspendUser` method to handle driver reinstatement**

## Expected Behavior

### Before the fix:

- Driver status showed based on `role` field (driver/admin/etc) instead of actual suspension status
- Suspend button might show for already suspended drivers
- Status indicators were incorrect
- Suspend action was in the table, creating clutter

### After the fix:

- Driver status correctly shows "Suspended" for drivers with `role_status = 'suspended'` and "Active" for drivers with `role_status = null` or any other value
- **Suspend action moved to feedback details dialog for better UX**
- **Table actions column simplified to show only "View Details" and suspension status**
- **Dialog has dedicated "Driver Management Actions" section**
- Status indicators correctly reflect suspension state with proper colors:
  - Red background for suspended drivers (`role_status = 'suspended'`)
  - Green background for active drivers (`role_status = null` or not 'suspended')

## Database Schema Understanding

In the `users` table:

- `role_status` is a nullable field
- Active drivers have `role_status = null` (this is the default state)
- Suspended drivers have `role_status = 'suspended'`
- **Unsuspended/approved drivers have `role_status = 'approved'`**
- The frontend now properly handles this by treating `null` values as 'active'

## Test Cases

1. **Active Driver Report (role_status = null)**
   - Status should show "Active" with green background in dialog
   - Table actions should only show "View Details" button
   - Dialog should show "Suspend Driver" button in the Driver Management Actions section

2. **Suspended Driver Report (role_status = 'suspended')**
   - Status should show "Suspended" with red background in dialog
   - Table actions should show "View Details" button only
   - Dialog should show both "Unsuspend Driver" button and "Driver is Suspended" status

3. **Approved Driver Report (role_status = 'approved')**
   - Status should show "Active (Approved)" with green background in dialog
   - Table actions should only show "View Details" button
   - Dialog should show "Suspend Driver" button in the Driver Management Actions section

4. **Driver Management Workflow**
   - Admin can suspend active drivers (null → 'suspended')
   - Admin can unsuspend suspended drivers ('suspended' → 'approved')
   - Status changes are immediately reflected after action
   - Dialog closes and data refreshes after successful action

5. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Table is cleaner with fewer action buttons
   - All driver management actions are centralized in the dialog
   - Clear visual separation between information and actions in dialog
   - Both suspend and unsuspend actions available as needed

## API Response Structure

The backend now returns:

```json
{
  "driverRole": "driver", // The user's role (driver, admin, etc.)
  "driverRoleStatus": "suspended", // The suspension status (suspended, active, etc.)
  "pickupLocation": "123 Main St", // Now properly fetched from booking
  "dropoffLocation": "456 Oak Ave" // Now properly fetched from booking
}
```
