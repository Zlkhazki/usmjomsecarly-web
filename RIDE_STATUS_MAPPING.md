# Ride Status Mapping Reference

## Database Status Enum Values (4 values only):
- `open` - Ride is scheduled/available for booking
- `ongoing` - Ride is currently in progress
- `ended` - Ride has been completed successfully  
- `closed` - Ride has been cancelled

## Frontend Display Mapping:
- `open` → "Scheduled" (Yellow badge)
- `ongoing` → "Active" (Blue badge)
- `ended` → "Completed" (Green badge)
- `closed` → "Cancelled" (Red badge)

## API Filter Mapping (Frontend → Database):
- `scheduled` → `open`
- `active` → `ongoing` 
- `completed` → `ended`
- `cancelled` → `closed`

## Tab Filter Implementation:
- Tab 0: "All Rides" (no status filter)
- Tab 1: "Completed Rides" (status: "completed" → filters for `ended`)
- Tab 2: "Active Rides" (status: "active" → filters for `ongoing`)
- Tab 3: "Cancelled Rides" (status: "cancelled" → filters for `closed`)

## Status Transitions:
1. `open` (Scheduled) → `ongoing` (Active) → `ended` (Completed)
2. `open` (Scheduled) → `closed` (Cancelled) 
3. `ongoing` (Active) → `closed` (Cancelled)

## Fixed Files:
- ✅ `server/controllers/rideController.js` - Updated status mappings
- ✅ `client/src/services/rideService.js` - Fixed cancelRide to use "closed"
- ✅ Frontend Vue component already had correct mappings

This ensures consistency between database enum values, API responses, and frontend display.
